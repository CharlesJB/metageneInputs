Description: The goal of this package is to create the groups of regions for a
    metagene analysis in GM12878 cell lines in hg19. There are two types of
    regions: promoters and enhancers. The promoters were created in the
    metagene package. The enhancers are extracted from Fantom5 using the
    FantomEnhancers.hg19 package. Both types of regions (promoters and
    enhancers) are further splitted in groups based on their expression levels.
    Tresholds values for each groups are calculated by splitting Fantom5's TSS
    (extracted with the FantomTSS.hg19 package) into quantiles.
